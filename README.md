# INFO

Hi there! Cirdan here. Thanks for checking out my EPUB versions of WCT's translation of ReZero! Here you'll find EPUBS for each chapter. They now have custom covers so that you can tell which chapter is which from a quick glance! These are temporary files. When Phantaminum finishes the compilation for each volume, I take down the chapter EPUB files from here. His compilations are much better than these, anyway! Find me on the WCT Discord server!

# FAQs

Q: "Can you make these in X format too for my Burger King eReader?"
A: Nope. These will always be EPUBS. EPUB is an open standard and is readable on mostly everything. If it doesn't work on your device, there's plenty of free converters out there. I recommend [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com).

Q: "Can you make these into one big compilation file?"
A: Nope. That's where my fellow cultist Phantaminum comes in. He makes the amazing volume compilations after every Phase with full-color art, etc. I don't want to detract from his work.

Q: "Why don't you link up footnotes?"
A: I don't know how to do that with Libreoffice Writer without causing mayhem.

Q: "Will you come back and edit these for typos?"
A: Maybe. It depends on how big of a deal they are, since these are temporary. If there's a major error that changes an entire passage or a translation error on our part, I will edit the EPUB files.
